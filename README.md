# working-and-understanding-VPN

## Objective:
Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and ensuring secure communication over the internet.

## Tools Used:
VPN Client: ProtonVPN Free Tier 
Web Browser: Google Chrome 
Wireshark: For traffic inspection

## Setup and Testing Steps:
- Choose a VPN
Selected ProtonVPN for its privacy-focused features and strong encryption

## 2. Install the VPN Client
Created a free account at protonvpn.com
**Downloaded and installed the ProtonVPN Windows client**

## 3. Connect to a VPN Server
-Logged into the ProtonVPN app.
-Selected a free server in the Netherlands (or closest available region).
-Clicked Connect and waited for confirmation of secure connection.

## 4. Verify IP Address Change
Before VPN: My IP address showed my actual location (e.g., India).
After VPN: New IP reflected a Netherlands-based location.

## 5. Check Encrypted Traffic
-Browsed several websites while VPN was active.
-Traffic remained uninterrupted.
-Confirmed HTTPS encryption was maintained.

## 6. Disconnect & Compare
**Disconnected the VPN**
-Rechecked IP address — it returned to my original ISP location.
-Browsing speeds were slightly faster after disconnection 
## VPN Encryption & Privacy Features
-Encryption: VPNs use AES-256 or ChaCha20 to secure traffic.
-rotocols: OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2 — different levels of speed and security.
-Privacy: Hides IP address, prevents ISP tracking, protects on public Wi-Fi.
-DNS Leak Protection: Prevents your DNS queries from exposing your real location.

## Benefits:
-Hides your IP and location from websites and ISPs
-Encrypts data, securing it from hackers especially on public Wi-Fi
-Bypasses geographic restrictions and censorship
-Maintains privacy even on untrusted networks

## Limitations:
-Free VPNs may have speed or data limits
-Not all VPNs are trustworthy (avoid unknown providers)
-Can slightly reduce internet speed due to encryption overhead
-Doesn’t make you fully anonymous (especially if logged into personal accounts)

## What I learned:
Through this task, I gained a solid understanding of how VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) work and their importance in securing online communication. 

**VPNs Protect Online Privacy**
I learned that a VPN hides my real IP address by routing my internet traffic through a remote server, making it difficult for websites, ISPs, or hackers to track my location or browsing activity.
Encrypted Internet Traffic.I saw how VPNs encrypt data using secure protocols like OpenVPN and WireGuard, which protects sensitive information—especially when using public Wi-Fi or untrusted networks.

**VPNs Can Bypass Geo-restrictions**
I realized that VPNs can also be used to access content restricted by region (e.g., websites or services only available in certain countries).

**Trade-off Between Speed and Security**
While using the VPN, I noticed a slight drop in browsing speed. This taught me that encryption can add latency and that free VPNs might be slower due to limited resources.

**Limitations of VPNs**
I learned that VPNs are not a complete solution for online anonymity. They can protect data in transit, but they don’t prevent tracking through cookies, browser fingerprinting, or logging into personal accounts.

**Hands-On VPN Setup and Testing**
Setting up ProtonVPN gave me practical experience in downloading, installing, and using a VPN client. I now understand how to connect to different servers and verify connection status.
